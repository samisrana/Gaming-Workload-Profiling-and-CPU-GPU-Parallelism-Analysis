### Real Game Performance Analysis: Rocket League

A real-world performance analysis of Rocket League demonstrates the practical application of our monitoring tools:

#### Resource Utilization Patterns
![CPU-GPU Usage Pattern](images/CPU-GPUrocketleague.png)

The graph above shows resource utilization across different game states, demonstrating key patterns in CPU-GPU interaction:

- **Launch Phase**: Initial low resource usage as the game starts up
- **Menu Phase**: 
  - Increased CPU activity for game setup and UI rendering
  - Gradual increase in GPU power consumption (11.45W to 43.46W)
  - Initial memory loading occurs
- **Gameplay Phase**: 
  - Peak GPU usage (~31%) with stable temperatures
  - Decreased CPU usage as GPU takes over rendering workload
  - Memory usage stabilizes around 43%, indicating efficient resource management
  - Consistent FPS throughout match duration
- **End Phase**: Gradual resource reduction

The analysis reveals efficient CPU-GPU load balancing with no significant bottlenecks, as evidenced by stable frame times and optimized resource distribution.
